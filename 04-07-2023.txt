Today I woke up and watched some videos to improve english . Then applied to some companies and then solved following questions (Just read they were easy and co-related to each other)
2. Find no of time the array is rotared ? 
3.first and last element of an array using binary search
4.Find the count of particular element in an sorted rotated array

Went to repair mobile battery to Someshwar and then spent some time with Hritik and Ranjan(1 to 4:30).Came home watched some videos on book allocation and search in sorted rotated array and also before that applied to a lot of companies.
